<h4>Requirements:</h4> Develop the following program using Anaconda/ Jupiter/ Spider and evaluate ML models. <br>
<h4>Experiment-1: </h4>
Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a 
given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file. <br><br>
<h4>Experiment-2: </h4>
For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training 
examples. <br><br>
<h4>Experiment-3: </h4>
Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate 
data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
<h4>Experiment-4: </h4>
Exercises to solve the real-world problems using the following machine learning methods: <br>
a) Linear Regression <br>
b) Logistic Regression <br>
c) Binary Classifier <br>
<h4>Experiment-5: </h4> Develop a program for Bias, Variance, Remove duplicates , Cross Validation
<h4>Experiment-6: </h4> Write a program to implement Categorical Encoding, One-hot Encoding 
<h4>Experiment-7: </h4>
Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Back propagation algorithm and test the same 
using appropriate data sets. 
<h4>Experiment-8: </h4>
Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print both correct 
and wrong predictions.
<h4>Experiment-9: </h4>Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm in order to fit data 
points. Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs. 
 
<h4>Experiment-10: </h4>
Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the na√Øve Bayesian Classifier model to 
perform this task. Built-in Java classes/API can be used to write the program. Calculate the accuracy, 
precision, and recall for your data set. 
<h4>Experiment-11: </h4> Apply EM algorithm to cluster a Heart Disease Data Set. Use the same data set for 
clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the 
quality of clustering. You can add Java/Python ML library classes/API in the program. 
<h4>Experiment-12: </h4>Exploratory Data Analysis for Classification using Pandas or Matplotlib. 
<h4>Experiment-13: </h4>
Write a Python program to construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to 
demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease Data Set
<h4>Experiment-14: </h4>
Write a program to Implement Support Vector Machines and Principle Component Analysis 
<h4>Experiment-15: </h4>
Write a program to Implement Principle Component Analysis
